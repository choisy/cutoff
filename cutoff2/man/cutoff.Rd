\title{Cutoff value for a bimodal distribution.}
\usage{
cutoff(object, t = 1e-64, nb = 10, distr = 2, type1 = 0.05,
  level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An output from the function \code{em}.}

\item{t}{A numerical scalar indicating the value below which the E-M
algorithm should stop.}

\item{nb}{Number of Monte Carlo simulations.}

\item{distr}{Either 1 or 2, indicates which distribution belonging the Type-I
error corresponds to. 1 correspond to the first distribution in \code{object}.}

\item{type1}{A numerical value between 0 and 1, the value of the type-I error.}

\item{level}{The confidence level required.}
}
\value{
Returns a numerical vector of lenght 3, the first value being the
  estimated value of the cutoff and the second and thrid values being the
  lower and upper bound of the confidence interval of this estimate, at the
  level specified by parameter \code{level}.
}
\description{
\code{cutoff} returns the cutoff value from a bimodal distribution, together
  with its confidence interval.
}
\details{
From a fitted finite mixture model, we compute the probability to belong to
one of the two probability distributions of the finite mixture model, as a
function of the datum value. This probability function is used to look for the
cutoff value defined as the datum value for which the probability to belong to
a given probability distribution is equal to a type-I error. The confidence
interval of this cutoff value is computed by Monte Carlo simulations where in
each iteration the five parameter values of the finite mixture model are
sampled in a multinormal distribution and then the cutoff value is computed.
The confidence interval of the cutoff value is computed by fitting a normal
distribution by maximum likelihood to the Monte-Carlo-derived values of the
cutoff. This last step is performed by the \code{fitdistr} function of the
\code{MASS} package.
